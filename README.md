# Dallas-Cowboys-WS-Project

#project web scraping data from nfl.com to retrieve current player information 

# all the files in this repository will give you the information I used to create the power bi dashboard

2. dallas_cowboys_roster - Extracted the results in from previous step to an excel document
3. Dallas Cowboys DB - Used the power query to create new calculated fields and imported the logo in the visulization
4. player positions - Used my background knowledge to create a calculated field to justify is players were on offense, defense, or special teams
